## Professional Experience

### Data Analyst Intern | LearnBasics | Sep 2024 - Apr 2025

During my internship at LearnBasics, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, reporting automation, and dashboard development, significantly contributing to operational efficiency and strategic insights.

* **Student Data Analysis:** Conducted in-depth analysis of student performance and behavioral data to identify key trends and provide actionable insights for educational improvements.
* **Report Automation:** Streamlined report generation by designing report templates using **LaTeX** and developing robust **SQL queries** for the backend team, enabling efficient and automated data fetching.
* **Dashboard Development:** Created and maintained interactive dashboards using **Metabase** to monitor critical operations (e.g., school and student test statuses) and support content management for test and question paper settings.
* **Dashboard Optimization:** Achieved a significant improvement in dashboard query retrieval performance, **reducing loading times from 2 minutes 36 seconds to an impressive 14 seconds** through meticulous query optimization.
* **AI Project Initiation:** Initiated an **AI project prototype** focused on analyzing student mistakes in tests and identifying underlying knowledge gaps using **Large Language Model (LLM) inference**, aiming to develop personalized learning interventions.
